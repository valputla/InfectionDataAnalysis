## Featured Notebooks and files
**CovidDeathRateAnalysis** 
- Using Pandas and visualization packages, to look at COVID-19, Influenza, and Pneumonia deaths in the US and Puerto Rico from 2020-2022.

**Provisional_COVID-19_Deaths_by_Sex_and_Age.csv**
- CSV file with our raw data. It looks at COVID-19, Influenza, and Pneumonia deaths by state, age group, gender, and month/year.

## Analysis and Observed Trends
A strong correlation was observed between Age Groups & COVID-19 Deaths of all the states in the US. This suggests the older you are, the risk of dying from COVID-19 is higher. This makes sense due to comorbidities of other diseases and differences in immune systems.
